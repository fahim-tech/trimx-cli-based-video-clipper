## üìà Priority Scoring System

### Priority Calculation
**Score = (Priority Weight √ó 3) + (Impact Weight √ó 2) + (Effort Weight √ó 1)**

**Priority Weights:**
- Critical: 4
- High: 3
- Medium: 2
- Low: 1

**Impact Weights:**
- High: 3
- Medium: 2
- Low: 1

**Effort Weights (inverted):**
- Very High: 1
- High: 2
- Medium: 3
- Low: 4

### Top Priority Items (by score)
1. **Basic video reading**: 4√ó3 + 3√ó2 + 3√ó1 = 21
2. **Copy mode clipping**: 4√ó3 + 3√ó2 + 2√ó1 = 20
3. **Test framework**: 3√ó3 + 3√ó2 + 4√ó1 = 19
4. **Basic error handling**: 3√ó3 + 2√ó2 + 3√ó1 = 16
5. **Re-encode mode**: 2√ó3 + 2√ó2 + 2√ó1 = 12
6. **Configuration system**: 2√ó3 + 2√ó2 + 3√ó1 = 13
7. **Hybrid mode**: 2√ó3 + 2√ó2 + 2√ó1 = 12
8. **Hardware acceleration**: 2√ó3 + 2√ó2 + 2√ó1 = 12
9. **Hexagonal architecture**: 1√ó3 + 1√ó2 + 1√ó1 = 6
