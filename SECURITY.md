Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### 3. Response timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on complexity and impact

### 4. Disclosure process

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- Once fixed, we will coordinate public disclosure
- Credit will be given to the reporter (unless requested otherwise)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always download from official sources
- Verify file signatures when available
- Keep the application updated
- Report suspicious behavior immediately

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all input data
- Use proper error handling
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security audits

## Known Security Considerations

### File System Access

TrimX requires file system access to read input files and write output files. The application:
- Validates file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Uses safe file operations
- Implements proper error handling for I/O operations

### FFmpeg Integration

The application uses FFmpeg libraries for media processing:
- Uses official FFmpeg builds
- Keeps FFmpeg dependencies updated
- Validates media file headers before processing

### Network Operations

Currently, TrimX does not perform network operations. Future versions may include:
- Update checking (opt-in)
- Analytics (opt-in)
- All network operations will be clearly documented and optional

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will include:
- Detailed changelog entries
- Security advisory if applicable
- Recommended immediate update
