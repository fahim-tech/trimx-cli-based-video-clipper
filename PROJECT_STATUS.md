## 🚨 Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **No Video Processing**: Cannot actually clip video files yet (libav integration needed)
- **No Adapter Implementations**: Port interfaces designed but concrete implementations needed
- **No Testing**: No automated tests for functionality
- **No Configuration**: Configuration system design exists but implementation needed
- **No CLI Functionality**: CLI structure planned but not implemented

### Technical Debt
- **Implementation Gap**: Design complete but no implementation started
- **Feature Documentation**: Many documented features not yet implemented
- **Test Coverage**: No test infrastructure despite claims
- **Build Complexity**: Simple build system vs documented complex requirements
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Documentation claims features are implemented when they're not
